## Overview

Pico WiFi Duck is a project that enables the emulation of a USB Rubber Ducky over Wi-Fi using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. This functionality allows for remote control and automation of target systems, making it a versatile tool for penetration testing and security assessments. This project is inspired by the [WIFI DUCK](https://github.com/spacehuhntech/wifiduck) project by [spacehuhn](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech).

## Features

- Emulates USB Rubber Ducky functionality over Wi-Fi.
- Remote scripting and automation capabilities.
- Requires only one Microcontroller.
- Based on the [pico-ducky](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky) project.
- Cost-effective, approximately $6 (40dt).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi Pico W.
- Micro-USB Cable.
- Basic Knowledge.

### Installation

1. **Install CircuitPython:**

   - Click [here](https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/bin/raspberry_pi_pico_w/fr/adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico_w-fr-8.0.0.uf2) to download (Version 8.0.0).
   - Plug the device into a USB port while holding the boot button. It will show up as a removable media device named RPI-RP2.
